    "\n",
    "Some of the official data sets are available from various agencies:\n",
    "- [The Australian Energy Market Operator](https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/wholesale-electricity-market-wem/data-wem) \n",
    "- [Western Power's Network Capacity Mapping Tool](https://www.westernpower.com.au/resources-education/calculators-tools/network-capacity-mapping-tool/)\n",
    "- [Data WA](https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/org/western-power)\n",
    "A basic gap analysis can be conducted to identify key SWIS elements that are missing from the Wikidata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unofficial data is also available from media reports and power project proponent web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "A review of SWIS data can be conducted by implementing SPARQL queries using the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/). See the code below for examples:"
